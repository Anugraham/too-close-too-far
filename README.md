# too close too far üéØ


## Basic Details

### Project Description
An Arduino detects object distance, triggering a Pygame mini-game if out of range. Players dodge obstacles with increasing difficulty, combining sensor data with interactive gameplay.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
To detect object under a specified range!!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The ultrasonic sensor detects the object and once in safe zone, you are good to go. BUT!!! If you're too close or too far from specified zone, then you're in danger zone and you have to play the a desktop game. Completely useless, isn't it?!
